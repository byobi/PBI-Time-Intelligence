# Power BI Time-Intelligence: Beyond the Basics
Time-Intelligence refers to analyzing and comparing calculations and metrics across time and is the most common type of business intelligence reporting. Power BI has a lot of built in capabilities to help you get started but these alone are not enough for many real-world solutions.

The key to truly mastering time-intelligence in Power BI is a good date table and understanding how to manipulate the filter context. This session will teach you how to do both!

In this (demo-heavy) session, we’ll quickly review Power BI’s built-in time intelligence capabilities and why you should avoid them! We’ll also cover the importance of a good date table, what attributes it should include, and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex time-intelligence calculations. Finally, we’ll breakdown many of the 40+ DAX time-intelligence functions, showing you how they work under the covers (hint: controlling context) and how they can used in combination to accommodate complex business logic.
